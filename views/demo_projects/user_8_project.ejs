      Note: Overall structure for the code was taken from free, open-source websites. The code is NOT an exact copy of the open-source code, as adaptions were made regarding the implementation, but a large percentage of our code remains identical to the source.

      Code for this timeline was taken from https://codepen.io/melnik909/pen/qPjwvq, from the website, http://freefrontend.com/css-timelines/#horizontal-timelines, which lists many different types of frontends. This code has been adjusted to fit in with our website, but by and large it remains the same.

      A tutorial on how to implement and create a timeline was also followed in the creation of this code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEybqzuh6Z0. While they use different timelines, the final implementation takes aspects from both.
